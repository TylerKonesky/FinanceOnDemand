                    Nobody is taught how to build, manage and preserve wealth. Your college didn't offer a course called Financial Freedom 101 and your high school didn't teach money skills. Yet, arguably, personal finance and wealth building principles are two of the most important educational lessons you can undertake. It can make the difference between a life full of purpose and security, or a life of pain, frustration and unhappiness.

                    Most people learn what little they know about investing and money from parents, friends, magazines, and books. Yet, if you examine these mentors you'll see that the magazine articles are generally written by professional writers rather than professional investors, and our friends, parents, and other mentors aren't qualified to teach financial education principles judging by their financial results.

                    We look to our parents as our first educators. They teach us to wash our hands, eat our vegetables and look both ways before crossing the street.
